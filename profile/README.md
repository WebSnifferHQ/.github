Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the WebSniffer project & organization.

[WebSniffer](https://websniffer.cc/) is an intelligence platform in the making that will track changes on the web and provide actionable insights. The online tool can currently view [HTTP response headers](https://websniffer.cc/) of any web page, do [domain name](https://websniffer.cc/domain), [IP address lookups](https://websniffer.cc/ip) and provides [user information](https://websniffer.cc/my) such as IP address, user agent and more.

If you want to stay up to date about the project's development, then subscribe to our free bi-weekly [WebSniffer newsletter](https://websniffer.substack.com/?showWelcome=true).
